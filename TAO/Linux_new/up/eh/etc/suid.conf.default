# has_savedsuid_support
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# Does your system have 'saved set-user-ID' support?
# 
# On a system with saved set-user-ID support, the effective uid of a process
# will be saved to 'saved set-user-ID' (structure prepared by OS) before euid
# is changed, thus the process can switch back to the previous euid if required.
# 
# If this option is set to 'no', openwebmail will try to save the euid 0 to ruid,
# this gives the same effect as 'saved set-user-ID' but is somewhat unsafe
# since the child forked by openwebmail may have ruid 0
# 
# Only set this to 'no' if you got 'authentication error' in changing the 
# passwd or permission denied error on the tmp file when used with speedycgi
