#
# config file for auth_pop3.pl
#

# This module assumes to be used in the following two case
#
# 1. users are located on remote pop3 server, or
# 2. users are virtual users on this machine
#
# and it will use one effectiveuser for all openwebmail users on the local machine.
#
# You have to do the following things to make the whole system work
#
# 1. decide what effectiveuser will openwebmail be executed as.
#
#    a. if you have root permission on this machine,
#       but you don't want to run openwebmail as suid scripts
#
#       1> install openwebmail as readme.txt described
#       2> cd cgi-bin/openwebmail
#       3> chmod u-s *pl to remove setuid bit from scripts
#       4> find the effectiveuser of your httpd, eg: nobody
#
#       ps:The effective user of httpd is normally 'nobody', 'www' or 'apache'. 
#          It could be found by executing 'ps -aux|grep -aux',
#
#       5> set option effectiveuser to 'nobody'
#       6> chown -R nobody cgi-bin/openwebmail/etc
#
#       Openwebmail effectiveuser will be always 'nobody'
#
#    b. if you have root permission on this machine,
#       and it is okay for you to run openwebmail as suid scripts
#       1> install openwebmail as readme.txt described
#       2> cd cgi-bin/openwebmail
#       3> find the effectiveuser of your httpd, eg: nobody
#       4> change option effectiveuser to 'nobody'
#
#       Openwebmail effectiveuser will switch to 'nobody' when user login
#
#    c. if you don't have root permission on this machine
#       and you want to run openwebmail with user, eg:owmail
#       1> login as owmail
#       2> mkdir public_html; cd public_html
#       3> tar -zxvBpf openwebmail-x.yy.tgz
#       4> cd cgi-bin/openwebmail
#       5> chmod u-s *pl to remove setuid bit from scripts
#       6> make the *.pl to be executed by user 'owmail'
#       ps: You may need to reference the manpage/document of your httpd to
#           know how to do user specific CGI
#       7> change option effectiveuser to 'owmail'
#
#       Openwebmail effectiveuser will be always 'owmail'
#
# 2. set the following options in openwebmail.conf
#
#    auth_module		auth_pop3.pl
#    mailspooldir		any directory that the runtime user could write
#    use_syshomedir		no
#    use_homedirspools		no
#    logfile			any file that runtime user could write
#    enable_changepwd		no
#    enable_autoreply		no
#    enable_setforward		no
#    authpop3_server		pop3 server for authentication (default:localhost)
#    authpop3_port		110
#    authpop3_getmail		yes
#    authpop3_delmail		yes
#    authpop3_usessl		no
#
# 3. if your users are not on remote server but virtual users on this machine
#    (eg: you use vm-pop3d on this machine for authentication)
#
#    a. you need to install openwebmail as described in step 1.b or 1.c
#       and the effectiveuser must be the same as the vm-pop3d.
#    b. replace the following two options in step 2
#
#       mailspooldir		the mailspool used by vmpop3d
#       authpop3_getmail	no


# effectiveuser
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# the effectiveuser that will be used for all users authenticated by 
# the authpop3 module

effectiveuser	nobody
