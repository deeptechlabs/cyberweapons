# -----------------------------------------------------------------------
# this can be either 'flock' or 'dotfile'
#
# Set this to 'dotfile' to use .lock file for filelock
# 'dotfile' lock is only recommended if the mailspool or user's homedir 
# are located on an remote nfs server and the lockd on your nfs server 
# or client has problems
#
# ps: the freebsd/linux nfs may need 'dotlock'. solaris doesn't.
