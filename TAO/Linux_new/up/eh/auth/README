This is the directory for authentication modules.
The config file for these module is located in ../etc.
For example, the config for auth_unix.pl will be ../etc/auth_unix.conf

If you are running openwebmail with SpeedyCGi,
each module will be loaded for most once
and any modification to the config file won't be seen 
after program starts up.

So if you have modified the config file, you have to run
'touch cgi-bin/openwebmail/openwebmail/openwebmail*pl'
to update the timestamp of openwebmail script files,
then SpeedyCGI will load the scripts again.
