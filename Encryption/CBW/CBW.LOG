Who:   Bob Baldwin
Why:   Had to learn about terminal independence sometime.
When:  10/8/86
What:  
- Change outline of lookup window to use graphics.
- Change graphics bit to 128 from 256.
- Change screen plstring to check graphics bit.
- The dictionary file found via a shell variable DICTIONARY.
  - Defaults to /usr/dict/words.
- Require that all control characters except \n and \t be
  quoted before they are inserted into the block.
  - Note problem with making C-Q or C-S active.
- Avoid the disperr() routine until the screen is initialized.
  - This fixes problems caused when termcap doesn't specify screen size.
  --> Don't avoid, just fix disperr not to call setcursor().
- Send init term sequence to terminal (if any).
- Speed up the graphic printing by remembering whether the term
  is in graphics mode.
- Fix bug that allowed the cursor to move off the screen, which caused
  the program to exit.
  - Force screen size to 24 x 80.
  - Change go_down behavior in user window.
- Have the PF4 key jump the cursor to the command line (if any).
  - Have C-X also do this.
- Fix formatting problems due to 4 char tab versus 8 char tab bug.
- Send sequence to active keypad.
- Have C-Z abort the current command (what about C-C?).
- Add a command to suspend the program and return to the shell.
  - This avoids the long wait on reading stats.
- In general need to provide a way to re-init terminal when
  program is exited and entered.
- Get the PF key definitions from the termcaps file.
- Add general keymap which can handle long sequences generated
  by a single keystroke.
- Init keymap from shell variable.
- Add graphics character map.
- Init from defaults and shell variable.
